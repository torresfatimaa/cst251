		<h1> Lab 5 : More Html </h1>
		<p> The goal of this lab was to create a well stuctured document that puts to use the coding techiniques we have slowly been learning. </p>
		<h2> Difficulties </h2>
		<p> The main difficulty I had in this lab was actually correctly adding in my images, i had to continously go back to read lab 3's html. I believe that it's due to the fact that this is still pretty fresh in my mind, i'm hoping there will be more practice and slowly, I wll be able to remember these codes off the top of my head ! </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> Down below you will be able to see my results of this lab, I have added two pictures, one is a picture of my 21st birthday cake, and also a link to my disposable/film instagram. I also have a picture of my cat, Gigi, which has a link embedded into it! The other links are just some of my favorite music vidoes, enjoy ! </p>
